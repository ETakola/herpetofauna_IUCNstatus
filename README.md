# Temporal changes in IUCN status of European herpetofauna
Shifts in the IUCN conservation status of European herpetofauna over time signal underlying ecological pressures and emerging conservation challenges. Quantitatively estimating these changes is essential for identifying species at greatest risk and evaluating the effectiveness of conservation measures over time. Herpetofauna, including amphibians and reptiles, are particularly sensitive to environmental changes, making them valuable bioindicators. By systematically analyzing shifts in IUCN statuses, researchers can uncover trends in extinction risk and link them to potential drivers such as habitat loss, land-use change, and especially climate change. Understanding these associations is crucial for predicting future vulnerabilities and guiding targeted conservation strategies across Europeâ€™s rapidly changing landscapes.
