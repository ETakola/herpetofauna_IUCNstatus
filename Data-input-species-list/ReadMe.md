# File description
* These three files contain the species lists for amphibians and reptiles organised in an alphabetical order. Each list contains two columns: genus and species. 
* These are the species lists that were imported in the "get_iucn..." script in order to extract all previous assessments for each species. 
* The species list for reptiles has been separated in two parts to avoid API connection failures.
